    <h2>Maryori Torres</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
    <img alt="Image of me?" src="images/myphoto.jpg" width="20%">

            </p>I am originally from Mexico, where I pursued a degree in Business Administration as my first academic endeavor.</p>
            </p>However, my deep passion for technology ignited a desire for a second career in web development.</p>
            </p>The Pathway program has opened an incredible door for me, allowing me to step onto this exciting new career path.</p>
            </p>This path not only promises improved job prospects but also provides the flexibility to work from the comfort of my home.</p>
            </p>One of my great passions in life is sports, with volleyball and tennis being my favorites.</p>
          </p>I find immense joy and fulfillment in playing these sports, and they have become an integral part of my lifestyle.</p>
